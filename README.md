# 1. Introduction

Have you ever wondered why retail stores like H&M, Pull & Bear and other brands have products laid out as you queue for check out? This is because of In-Store Foot Traffic (Footfall) Analytics! A conscious decision to increase the number of sales as consumers proceed to check out.

Footfall Analytics for Retail Stores is a powerful data-driven market research mechanism that may be implemented to grow your sales in any business environment (eg. Central Business District (CBD), Cities, Towns, etc.).

Robust Machine Learning Models are able to analyse granular data and provide a demographic analysis to create a Collective Consumer Portrait which is tailor-made for all your retail outlets across the nation!

# 2. In-Store Retail Foot Traffic Analytics 
As mentioned there are several types of Footfall Analysis as listed: 

1. Zone Analytics 
2. Dwell Time Analytics 
3. Traffic Period Analytics 
4. Customer Purchase Analytics 

For this case study, a human/object detection system (Python Code) was designed to demonstrate the Traffic Period Analytics of consumers in a Home Care Store using CCTV footage (part of an IoT network in a store) lasting 1.5 minutes. 

This footfall analysis is designed to study the daily high and low traffic periods in the Home Care Store. This analysis acts as a baseline for further investigation by using other analytical methods. 

Question is, how can one increase the sales of "selected items"?

What are "selected items"? 

Selected items - Items that have the least amount of sales on a monthly. 

## 2.1. Methodology

## 2.2. Results (From Working System)

# 3. General Recommendations

Having a single system to gather data will not provide reliable analysis. Thus, it is important to expand on several IoT equipment that will allow the Home Care Store make directed marketing decisions to increase sales of "selected items". 

Cloud device integration of IoT equipment is the way forward!
