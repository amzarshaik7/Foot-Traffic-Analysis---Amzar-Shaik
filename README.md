# 1. Introduction

In-Store Foot Traffic (Footfall) Analytics for Retail Stores is a powerful data-driven market research mechanism that may be implemented to grow your retail business in any environment (eg. Central Business District (CBD), Cities, Towns, etc.).

Traditional methods to measure foot traffic which have been used in the past comprises of:
1. Tally or Clicker Counting
2. Security and Cameras Systems

However, traditional methods do not mine granular data or provide a demographic analysis which can be used by modern and robust Machine Learning Models to create a Collective Consumer Portrait!

A human/object detection system was designed to demonstrate the Traffic Period Analytics of consumers in a Home Care Store using CCTV footage lasting 1.5 minutes. This footfall analysis is designed to study the daily high and low traffic periods in the Home Care Store. This analysis acts as a baseline for further investigation by using other analytical methods.
