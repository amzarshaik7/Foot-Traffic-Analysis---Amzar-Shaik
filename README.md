# 1. Introduction

In-Store Foot Traffic (Footfall) Analytics for Retail Stores is a powerful data-driven market research mechanism that may be implemented to grow your retail business in any environment (eg. Central Business District (CBD), Cities, Towns, etc.).

Traditional methods to measure foot traffic which have been used in the past comprises of:
1. Tally or Clicker Counting
2. Security and Cameras Systems

However, traditional methods do not mine granular data or provide a demographic analysis which can be used by modern and robust Machine Learning Models to create a Collective Consumer Portrait!

# 2. In-Store Retail Foot Traffic Analytics 
As mentioned there are several types of Footfall Analysis as listed: 

1. Zone Analytics 
2. Dwell Time Analytics 
3. Traffic Period Analytics 
4. Customer Purchase Analytics 

For this case study, a human/object detection system was designed to demonstrate the Traffic Period Analytics of consumers in a Home Care Store using CCTV footage (which can be part of an IoT network in a store) lasting 1.5 minutes. 

This footfall analysis is designed to study the daily high and low traffic periods in the Home Care Store. This analysis acts as a baseline for further investigation by using other analytical methods. 

Question is, how can one increase the sales of "selected items"?

## 2.1. Methodology

## 2.2. Results (From Working System)

# 3. General Recommendations

Having a single system to gather data will not provide reliable analysis. Thus, it is important to expand on several IoT equipment that will allow the Home Care Store make directed marketing decisions to increase sales of "selected items".
