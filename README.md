# 1. Introduction

Have you ever wondered why retail stores like H&M, Pull & Bear and other brands have products laid out as you queue for check out? This is because of In-Store Foot Traffic (Footfall) Analytics! A conscious decision to increase the number of sales as consumers proceed to check out.

Footfall Analytics for Retail Stores is a powerful data-driven market research mechanism that may be implemented to grow your sales in any business environment (eg. Central Business District (CBD), Cities, Towns, etc.).

Robust Machine Learning Models are able to analyse granular data and provide a demographic analysis to create a Collective Consumer Portrait which is tailor-made for all your retail outlets across the nation!

## 1.1. Problem Statement

An unnamed retail client have requested Maxis to understand the foot traffic of shoppers in their retail stores across the nation. The analysis is done with the use of IoT equipment and data analysis.

## 1.3 Assumptions 

1. Unbudgeted project
2. Problem assumed to be; increase the sales of "selected items"
   selected items - Items that have the least amount of sales on a monthly 
3. A sample dataset (mp4 video) at a Home Care Store is used for analysis 

# 2. In-Store Retail Foot Traffic Analytics 
As mentioned there are several types of Footfall Analysis as listed: 

1. Zone Analytics 
2. Dwell Time Analytics 
3. Traffic Period Analytics 
4. Customer Purchase Analytics 

For this case study, a human detection system (Python Code) was designed to demonstrate the Traffic Period Analytics of consumers in a Home Care Store using CCTV footage (part of an IoT network in a store) lasting ~ 1.5 minutes. 

This footfall analysis is designed to study the daily high and low traffic periods in the Home Care Store. This analysis acts as a baseline for further improvment of the footfall analysis.

Question is, how can one increase the sales of "selected items"?

# 3. General Recommendations

Having a single system to gather data will not provide reliable analysis. Thus, it is important to expand on several IoT equipment that will allow the Home Care Store make directed marketing decisions to increase sales of "selected items". 

Integration (Cloud, API, etc.) of IoT equipment for data extraction and analysis is the way forward!
