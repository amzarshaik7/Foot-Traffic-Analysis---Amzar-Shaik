# 1. Introduction

Have you ever wondered why retail stores like H&M, Pull & Bear and other brands have products laid out as you queue for check out? This is because of In-Store Foot Traffic (Footfall) Analytics! A conscious decision to increase the number of sales as consumers proceed to check out.

Footfall Analytics for Retail Stores is a powerful data-driven market research mechanism that may be implemented to grow your sales in any business environment (eg. Central Business District (CBD), Cities, Towns, etc.).

Robust Machine Learning Models are able to analyse granular data and provide a demographic analysis to create a Collective Consumer Portrait which is tailor-made for all your retail outlets across the nation!

## 1.1. Problem Statement

An unnamed retail client has engaged Maxis to understand the foot traffic of shoppers in their retail stores across the nation. The analysis is done with the use of IoT equipment and data analysis.

## 1.2. Objective

## 1.3 Assumptions 

The following is a list of assumptions made to perform the case study: 
1. Unbudgeted project
2. Problem assumed to be; increase the sales of "selected items" (Items that have the least amount of sales on a monthly) 
3. A sample dataset (mp4 video) at a Home Care Store is used for analysis 

# 2. In-Store Retail Foot Traffic Analytics 
As mentioned there are several types of Footfall Analysis as listed: 

1. Zone Analytics 
2. Dwell Time Analytics 
3. Traffic Period Analytics 
4. Customer Purchase Analytics 

For this case study, a human detection system (Python Code) was designed to demonstrate the Traffic Period Analytics of consumers in a Home Care Store using CCTV footage (part of an IoT network in a store) lasting ~ 1.5 minutes. 

This footfall analysis is designed to study the daily high and low traffic periods in the Home Care Store. This analysis acts as a baseline for further improvement of the footfall analysis.

Question is, how can one increase the sales of "selected items"?

## 2.1. Methodology

## 2.2. Results (From Working System)

The human detection system designed on Python is able to count the number of people at the foyer area. Consumer activity is high between 11.12 am and 11.13 am at the foyer area.

The Python Code can be refined further to improve the following: 
1. Distinguish the difference between human and object
2. Avoid multiple detection of the same person/consumer
3. Increase speed of CCTV Footage  

# 3. Recommendation

The human detection system designed is a great tool to study the traffic rate during operational hours. The analytics has provided a basis to strategize the sale of "selected items" as listed:

1. Place boxes with "selected items" to the left of the entrance during high traffic period. 
2. Consumers have the tendency to look left as they enter the store. 
3. This will encourage the consumers to buy "selected items".

# 4. Conclusion - Further Improvements
Integration (Cloud, API, etc.) of IoT equipment for data extraction and analysis is the way forward! 

The integration of the selected analytics as shown in diagram below, has been recommended specifically for retail stores. The data that can be gathered into a database with the inclusion of:
1. Thermal Detection System - Understand the zone consumers spend the most time at and allow us to place the "selected items".
2. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System - Understand the stand out purchases and place "selected items" close to the highest bought items.

The integration of the listed systems will provide a better demographic analysis for the retail stores across the nation to make directed marketing decisions to increase sales of any products.
